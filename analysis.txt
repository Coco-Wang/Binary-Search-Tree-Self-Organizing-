The worst-case time complexity of function height(BSTNode*t) is 
Big-O(N).

The worst-case occurs when all the nodes are in the right/left side of 
the root. So in order to determine the height, we have to transverse 
every node in the tree. And the time complexity is O(N).

But if the nodes are balanced distributed, we can achieve the complexity 
of O(log N).
